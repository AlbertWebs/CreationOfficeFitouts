So it makes sense to have dedicated spaces to put important documents. Besides files, we’ll also need to store gear and other valuable items.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you’ve ever seen the movie <em>Office Space</em>, you might recall when Peter Gibbons takes remodeling into his own hands and dismantles the cubicle wall blocking his view out the window. Anyone who has worked in a similar environment has thought about how nice it would be to switch things up. We can avoid impromptu employee repairs by planning a productive office environment.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>What factors should you consider when making an office remodeling plan?</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Before we go shopping, we have a variety of factors to consider. So let’s explore a handful of essential variables to have in mind for your next office design.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol><li><strong>Seek &zwnj;feedback from employees</strong></li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Include employees in the planning process&zwnj;. They can offer guidance on prioritizing design choices. Let workers pick the products they’ll be working with every day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Consider the number of people working at the same time</strong></li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Make the most out of every room. First, estimate the maximum number of employees in the office simultaneously. Then figure out how many people can fit comfortably in each room.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Account for remote workers</strong></li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The popularity of remote work has prompted the restructuring of offices everywhere. Some offices now have smaller work areas and plan on a percentage of their staff working remotely. If the team is remote, we may not need a desk for every employee.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>Plan for growth</strong></li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Planning for growth will help you decide how much space and stuff you need. For example, we want to avoid situations where we don’t have enough chairs or have to change offices when business booms. So it makes sense to have some extra growing room.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\"><li><strong>Make dedicated spaces</strong></li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While smaller offices may rely on a modular approach, finding rooms dedicated to specific tasks is normal. Make unique spaces for collaboration, relaxation, and work.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>What are the key components of a functional office space?</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We must ensure we cover all the bases. We want to make sure our new office looks professional and fosters a productive environment. Below is a list of critical components to hitting a home run in creating a functional workspace.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>What types of seating do offices need?</strong></li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We have several types of seating solutions to consider. The size and structure of our company will ultimately determine the importance of each type. Let’s look at the seating we’ll need to accommodate.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Desk chairs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Navigating the workday requires a proper captain’s seat. Every office desk needs a comfortable and <a href=\"https://blog.officedesigns.com/work-space/ergonomic-office-chairs-shipping-today/\">ergonomic chair</a>. Chairs see a lot of action, so they need to be high quality. Set workers up for success with comfortable, supportive, and durable chairs. They’ll sail through their shifts in comfort.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lounge seating</strong><br>For companies working with clients in person, lounge seats are crucial. Every presentable lobby has at least a couple of chairs. People need a place where they can sit and wait.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><br>Lounge seating is vital for improving relaxation in open workspaces. Adding plenty of comfortable seating to open areas makes collaboration possible.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Break areas</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>People need a place to eat that isn’t their desk. Break areas benefit from kitchen seating that is easy to clean. If there isn’t a lounge area, a few pieces of cozy furniture can make it easier for workers to recharge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Which desks are important for offices?</strong></li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Desks come in all shapes and sizes. The best idea is to pick desks that fit the space. Every office has different needs. Thankfully, we have plenty of options for creating any work center. Consider a combination of the following &zwnj;desks:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li><strong>Bench desks </strong>– Easy to line up in rows and against walls.</li><li><strong>Corner desks</strong> – Maximize every square foot of space by adding <a href=\"https://officedesigns.com/corner-desks/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://officedesigns.com/corner-desks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">desks to corners.</a></li><li><strong>Standard desks</strong> – Pick <a href=\"https://officedesigns.com/standard-desks/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://officedesigns.com/standard-desks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">traditional desks</a> strong enough for the daily grind.</li><li><strong>Laptop desks</strong> – Get things done in any room with portable and adjustable desks.</li><li><strong>Height-adjustable desks</strong> – Use <a href=\"https://blog.officedesigns.com/uncategorized/sit-stand-desks-and-converters-our-favorite-five/\">standing desks</a> to switch from sitting to standing quickly.<br></li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>What kind of tables make sense for offices?</strong></li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We use tables where desks don’t fit the bill. There is a different &zwnj;table out there for every unique office need. Add these to your office planning checklist:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li><strong>Conference tables</strong> – Large meeting rooms benefit from <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://officedesigns.com/conference-tables/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://officedesigns.com/conference-tables/\" target=\"_blank\">conference tables</a>.</li><li><strong>Shared workspace tables</strong> – Tables dedicated to shared workspaces can be more practical than lining up desks.</li><li><strong>Coffee tables</strong> – The &zwnj;ingredient to completing any lounge is a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://officedesigns.com/coffee-tables\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://officedesigns.com/coffee-tables\" target=\"_blank\">coffee table</a> with magazines.</li><li><strong>End tables</strong> – An <a href=\"https://officedesigns.com/end-tables/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://officedesigns.com/end-tables/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">end table</a> is fantastic next to comfortable seating and when coffee tables are too big.</li><li><strong>Dining tables</strong> – We must have a place to put the cake on cake day.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CMZVJ5luXIvqnzaLlDWNzS88hFbHwuSPUn4HVQFFg-0kfgHtQnGmERYpcUpSXHF_cfiYNU-xaCtGAlx22iD0-zeftOlSi_lEFAlpRx11_-MA8q9GTsYgZLwqjilhMNK9GH0xgHDkOc9fQ6N_Sw\" alt=\"\" data-no-retina=\"true\"></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tall supply storage cabinets</strong><br>Tall storage cabinets are excellent for office supplies. They make them sturdy enough to support hundreds of pounds. We need cabinets for pens, paper clips, and reams of paper. Lockable options make it easy for one person to manage inventory.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Filing cabinets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Paperwork finds its way into files, and files need cabinets. They make filing cabinets in all shapes and sizes; tall, wide, or on wheels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bookcases</strong><br>We use bookcases to store binders, paper, and educational materials. Anything that doesn’t need the security of a cabinet door can go in a bookcase.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wall shelves</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Use wall shelves in places where bookcases don’t fit. Shelves are modular versions of bookcases.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cubbies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Storage cubes excel at holding files or supplies and look extra cool in cubbies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\"><li>Which office accessories are crucial?</li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>After covering the fundamentals, it’s time to deck out the place with accessories. Of course, accessories are optional, but some choices offer a lot of functionality.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Desk accessories</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It’s the little things in life that make all the difference. We have a lot of inventions that help us get through the day in the office. Remember to shop for the following <a href=\"https://officedesigns.com/desk-accessories/\">desk accessories</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://officedesigns.com/floor-mats/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://officedesigns.com/floor-mats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Floor mat</a> for office chairs</li><li>Underneath the desk <a href=\"https://officedesigns.com/footrests/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://officedesigns.com/footrests/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">footrests</a></li><li>Cord organizers and modesty screens</li><li>Paper and <a href=\"https://officedesigns.com/keyboard-trays/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://officedesigns.com/keyboard-trays/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">keyboard trays</a></li><li>Computer <a href=\"https://officedesigns.com/monitor-arms/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://officedesigns.com/monitor-arms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">monitor arms</a></li><li>Padded standing mats and lumbar supports</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Coat racks</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Most of us live somewhere that requires wearing a coat for some time throughout the year. Use a coat rack so workers and clients don’t have to carry their wet gear around. Place a heat source or fan near the rack to improve drying times.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Space dividers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Dividing workspaces improves productivity and reduces distractions. Cubicles or space dividers create zones streamlined for productivity.<br><br><strong>Whiteboards</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Working in offices is more wonderful with whiteboards. They’re great for tracking the progress of team projects. Whiteboards also make brainstorming sessions a breeze. You won’t find many offices without at least one whiteboard.&nbsp;<br></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/94Q82bX3sK1iPSvqfWy9m8IZxKb9IeOXKDGS-rL2oBK4eSsqXGPG8hObGXLY23XWi7_Y8fBvNdJ8J3QZ177L12aqeRnRR-rnuEJNjOWi-InnM3hm0lcVOGPXa_7Pg2taqA3zo5rCKlcyk2sfeg\" alt=\"\" data-no-retina=\"true\"></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"6\"><li>How important is decorating the outside of an office?</li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Don’t forget to deck out any outdoor spaces. It doesn’t take much to transform a boring old patio, balcony, or porch into a relaxing place.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>People need a place outside for eating and phone calls. Plus, it’s always fun to bring a laptop outside for work on a nice day—as long as you have a comfortable place to sit. Workers will love seeing outdoor tables, chairs, and stools.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Put a few yard gnomes on display for good measure. We can never have enough yard art!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"7\"><li>Which office decor items should have priority?</li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>After covering the important stuff, we can spruce up our office decor. The idea is to use anything leftover from our budget to upgrade the office’s appearance. Add some elegance with the following pieces:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://officedesigns.com/search/?search_query=clocks\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://officedesigns.com/search/?search_query=clocks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wall and desk clocks</a></li><li><a href=\"https://officedesigns.com/search/?search_query=mirror#/filter:categories:Mirrors\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://officedesigns.com/search/?search_query=mirror#/filter:categories:Mirrors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Decorative mirrors</a></li><li>Tasteful flower vases, bowls, and plates</li><li>Magazine racks and umbrella holders<br></li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"8\"><li>What about creating a flexible workspace?</li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We make flex spaces usable for a variety of purposes. Some folks might need to have an impromptu collaboration session. Others may appreciate the change in scenery from their usual station. We can use any unused areas for flex space. Flex spaces usually have a combination of the following items:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li><strong>Mobile tables</strong> – Movable tables, <a href=\"https://officedesigns.com/laptop-desks/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://officedesigns.com/laptop-desks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">laptop stands</a> on wheels, and end tables.</li><li><strong>Modular soft seating</strong> – Ottomans, sectionals, and comfy chairs.</li><li><strong>Bench desking</strong> – Desks that can accommodate multiple workspaces</li><li><strong>Personal storage lockers</strong> – Lockers are handy for shared offices.<br></li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"9\"><li>How much additional lighting do you need?</li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Guarantee a bright future with plenty of <a href=\"https://officedesigns.com/lighting/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://officedesigns.com/lighting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">office lighting</a>. Use desk, table, and floor lamps to brighten rooms. Wall sconces add flare to conference rooms, lounges, or hallways. Consider using lights that attach to walls for space-limited areas.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>How do you make sure you’re staying within regulations and building codes?</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Doing things the right way is important. Renovating offices requires knowing all the regulations and staying within building codes. For example, some remodeling tasks require permits, while other jobs do not.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We can use designers for things like paint without worrying about permits. However, we’ll still have to ensure we meet any applicable code requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re planning on putting up, moving, or removing walls, you’ll need an architect.

The dust and debris can also be overwhelming. However, we can do a few things to cope with construction occurring in established offices.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Announce the remodeling plans</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Give employees plenty of time to prepare by letting them know the construction dates in advance. Hold important client meetings offsite until the repairs are complete.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Take home valuables and cover desks</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Construction is dirty and hazardous. Take home anything valuable that might not withstand a mishap. Cover desks with sheets to keep the dust and debris off desks and computers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Encourage remote work</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Ask workers to connect remotely to minimize hazards and expedite the process. Fewer distractions for workers and contractors equals faster project completion.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We want to create a space that makes it easy to have meetings or work independently. It’s best if we can solicit input from employees to guide office design choices. Items that get the most use—chairs, desks, lighting—should have priority over decorative nice-to-haves. Empty offices are much easier to remodel than existing ones, so closing the office for renovation may be worth considering. Modular items make it easier to switch things up on the fly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Summary</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Planning an office space is a lot of work. Make the process easier by assessing needs, surveying workers, and creating a checklist of fundamentals. We’ll set ourselves up for success by thinking about as much in advance as possible. This guide outlines important factors to consider, key components of offices, following regulations, and coordinating with employees during renovations. If we make the office nice enough initially, we won’t have to worry about workers taking down walls—like Peter Gibbons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>This is an article written by Ryan Mahoney.

Whether you\'re planning a new office or renovating an existing one, the success of your project often hinges on selecting the right office contractor. In this blog, we\'ll delve into the key considerations and steps to ensure you make an informed decision when hiring an office contractor for your next project.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>Define Your Project Goals:</strong><br>\r\nBefore embarking on the search for an office contractor, clearly define your project goals. Are you looking to create a modern, collaborative workspace, or is functionality your top priority? Understanding your objectives will help you communicate effectively with potential contractors and ensure they align with your vision.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>Research and Shortlist:</strong><br>\r\nStart by researching reputable office contractors in your area. Seek recommendations from colleagues, check online reviews, and explore portfolios of past projects. Create a shortlist of contractors who have experience in projects similar to yours and possess a positive track record.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>Check Credentials and Licenses:</strong><br>\r\nVerify the credentials and licenses of the contractors on your shortlist. A legitimate contractor should be properly licensed and insured. This not only protects you from liability but also indicates a level of professionalism and adherence to industry standards.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>Review Past Projects:</strong><br>\r\nExamine the contractor\'s portfolio to gauge the quality of their work. Look for diversity in their past projects and ensure they have experience working on offices similar to yours. This step provides insights into their capabilities and the aesthetics they can achieve.\r\n\r\nAsk for References:</strong><br>\r\nRequest references from past clients to gain firsthand insights into the contractor\'s performance. Inquire about their communication skills, adherence to timelines, and ability to stay within budget. A contractor with satisfied clients is more likely to deliver a positive experience for your project.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>Get Detailed Bids:</strong><br>\r\nOnce you\'ve narrowed down your list, request detailed bids from the remaining contractors. The bid should include a breakdown of costs, a timeline for completion, and a list of materials to be used. Thoroughly review each bid to ensure it aligns with your budget and expectations.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>Communication is Key:\r\nEffective communication is crucial throughout the project. Choose a contractor who is responsive, open to feedback, and proactive in addressing concerns. A transparent line of communication ensures that everyone is on the same page, reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>Consider Sustainability:</strong><br>\r\nIf sustainability is a priority for your business, inquire about the contractor\'s approach to environmentally friendly practices. A contractor with experience in sustainable construction can help you create an eco-friendly office space that aligns with your values.\r\n\r\nReview the Contract Thoroughly:</strong><br>\r\nBefore finalizing your decision, carefully review the contract. Ensure that all terms, costs, and project details are clearly outlined. If there are any ambiguities, address them with the contractor before signing.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>Collaborate and Monitor Progress:</strong><br>\r\nOnce the project is underway, maintain open communication with the contractor. Regularly monitor progress and address any issues promptly. A collaborative approach ensures that the final result meets your expectations.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>\r\nChoosing the right office contractor is a critical step in the success of your office project. By following these steps and conducting thorough research, you can make an informed decision that aligns with your goals, budget, and timeline. Remember, a well-executed office space not only enhances productivity but also reflects the values and identity of your business.\r\n\r\n\r\n', NULL, NULL, NULL);

We are rigorously banning all spammy vendors who do not pass our quality threshold and leave only the very best ones.

(98, 'Olivia Johnson', 'Gd\'Day Mate!\r\n\r\nFirstly we are not selling anything.\r\n\r\nUnless you have been living off the grid with no internet, the mainstream media has been reporting news on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\nTesla buys $1.5 billion in bitcoin, plans to accept it as payment\r\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1point5-billion-in-bitcoin.html\r\n\r\nWeeks After $1B Bitcoin Purchase, MicroStrategy Buys Another $15M Worth Of Cryptocurrency\r\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/weeks-1b-bitcoin-purchase-microstrategy-163558608.html\r\n\r\nIf you are new to cryptocurrencies, our tip for you is NOT to buy Bitcoin now. There are literally thousands of cryptocurrencies, as with all things in life, some are gems (with potential to x10 or x100) and most are garbage which eventually will go to zero.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is the KING coin in the crypto world, all other crypto currencies are collectively known as altcoins.\r\n\r\nWhat is altcoin season\r\n\r\nWhile everyone has been focusin on Bitcoin, there is a term \"Altcoin Season\" when the prices of good altcoins can go up times 10 or even x 100 in a crazy rally. This is mainly due to speculators who have made crazy gains from Bitcoins to smaller cap coins in order to chase gains.\r\n\r\nYou can literally turn $1000 into $10,000 or even $100,000 in an altcoin season (which seems to be happening now).\r\n\r\nAfter an altcoin rally which usually lasts 50 to 60 days, prices will crash hard (what goes up in a parabolic move must come down always).\r\n\r\nAnd if you can turn $1000, into $10,000 during this altcoin rally which is happening soon, we advise you to rotate your profits into bitcoin (King coin) as Bitcoin becomes relatively \"cheap\" compared to altcoins until Nov this year.\r\n\r\nYou can likely turn $10,000 into $10000 in the next bitcoin run up until Nov 2021 (a repeat of what Bitcoin and the market did in the last bull run in 2017). History does not repeat exactly but history certainly rythmes!\r\n\r\nAnd you have another chance to turn $10,000 into $1000,000 (thats 1 million) in the last leg of the altcoin rally which is likely to happen at the end of this year.\r\n\r\nWe understand there is no fundamentals to cryptos and this is a high risk game. But with the Federal Reserve holding down interest rates and printing more currencies (with the central banks around the world), the risk-reward for entering the crypto markets is simply too good.\r\n\r\nAltcoins we recommend:\r\n\r\nZilliqa coin (ZIL) which you can buy in Binance (here -> http://bit.ly/2L6ZySg)\r\n\r\nZIL coin is a project from Singapore, a country that is politically stable and widely known as a city that embraces Cryptocurrenies. The Central bank of Singapore has launched the Singapore Dollar as a crypto stable coin in Zilliaq blockchain.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/MAS/ProjectUbin/Project-Ubin-DvP-on-Distributed-Ledger-Technologies.pdf?la=en&hash=2ADD9093B64A819FCC78D94E68FA008A6CD724FF\r\n\r\nWe believe you cannot go too wrong when you follow what the government of Singapore is pursuing. ZIL is currently trading around USD$0.20.

(101, 'Olivia Johnson', 'Gd\'Day Mate!\r\n\r\nIn the crypto world, Binance is the biggest brand around and they offer an ecosystem of crypto services around their own cryptocurrency - the Binance coin (or BNB).\r\n\r\nBNB powers the Binance Ecosystem and is the native coin of the Binance Chain and the Binance Smart Chain. BNB has several use cases:\r\n\r\nPay for trading fees on the Binance exchange;\r\n\r\nPay for trading fees on Binance DEX (Decentralized Exchange);\r\n\r\nPay for transaction fees on the Binance Chain;\r\n\r\nPay for transaction fees on the Binance Smart Chain;\r\n\r\nPay for goods and services for both online and in-store purchases (e.g., using Binance Card or Binance Pay);\r\n\r\nBook hotels, flights and more at Travala.com;\r\n\r\nCommunity utility token on the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem (such as games and DApps);\r\n\r\nParticipate in token sales hosted on the Binance Launchpad;\r\n\r\nDonate on Binance Charity;\r\n\r\nProvide liquidity on Binance Liquid Swap;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Binance Coin (BNB)?\r\nBNB was launched through an Initial Coin Offering (or ICO) that took place from June 26th to July 3rd, 2017 - 11 days before the Binance Exchange opened for trading. The issue price was 1 ETH for 2,700 BNB or 1 BTC for 20,000 BNB.\r\n\r\nBNB was issued as an ERC-20 token, running on the Ethereum network, with a total supply of 200 million coins. 100 million BNBs were offered in the ICO, but the current total supply is lower due to periodic burning events. If you want to know more about coin burns, and why BNBs are being permanently destroyed, check out What Is a Coin Burn?.\r\n\r\nAlthough initially based on the Ethereum network, the ERC-20 BNB tokens were later swapped with BEP-2 BNB on a 1:1 ratio. The BEP-2 BNB is the native coin of the Binance Chain, and the mainnet launch was announced on April 18th, 2019.\r\n\r\nIn September 2020, Binance launched the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which is a blockchain network that runs in parallel with the Binance Chain. This means that you can now find BNB in three different forms: \r\n\r\nBNB BEP-2 on the Binance Chain.\r\n\r\nBNB BEP-20 on the Binance Smart Chain.\r\n\r\nBNB ERC-20 on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nWhat is BNB used for?\r\nAs mentioned, BNB has many use cases. For instance, you can use BNB to pay for your travel expenses, buy virtual gifts, and much more. But let’s take a look at how BNB can help you with trading fees. Here’s how to buy BNB right away! \r\n\r\nWhen trading on the Binance Exchange, each trade will incur a standard fee of 0.1% (trading fees are determined by your monthly trading volume and BNB holdings). You can either pay the trading fees using the assets you are trading or you can pay for them with BNB. If you choose to pay in BNB, you will get a special discount.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if you trade a lot on Binance, you should consider getting BNB and using them to pay for your fees. Keep in mind that the deduction for trading fees follows a specific schedule, so make sure to check the current spot trading Fee Schedule. It\'s also worth noting that the Binance Futures platform follows a slightly different Fee Schedule.\r\n\r\nApart from discounted trading fees, BNB is also powering the Binance DEX (on the Binance Chain) and hundreds of applications that are running on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\r\n\r\n\r\nBinance coin is trading at around $280 USD per coin at the time of writing this, we expect this to increase by another 100% at least in the next rally.
